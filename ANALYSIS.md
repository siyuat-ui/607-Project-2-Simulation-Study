My choice is option B - original simulation.

## Design Justification

### Distribution Selection
- **Normal**: Symmetric baseline
- **Exponential**: Right-skewed, unbounded
- **Uniform**: Bounded with hard edges
- **Lognormal**: Heavy tail, positive-only
- **Chi-Square**: Moderate skewness

**Why**: Span key challenges—symmetry, support types, tail behavior.

### Sample Sizes
- **n=100**: Small-sample regime
- **n=500**: Typical practical size
- **n=1000**: Large enough for stability

### Network architecture
- **128-dim input noise**: Sufficient randomness capacity
- **3 layers × 64 units**: Balances capacity with speed
- **Fixed hyperparameters**: LR=1e-4, batch=128, patience=20

## Fairness and Bias Control

- Identical architecture for all distributions
- Equal training budget (same epochs, stopping criteria)
- 10 replications per configuration
- Consistent metrics (MMD, KS tests, distances)
- No per-distribution tuning

## Limitations

**Scope**: Only 1D continuous distributions; no multivariate, discrete, or mixture models; single architecture; no baseline comparisons.

**Missing Scenarios**: High dimensions (d>10), time series, conditional generation, very small samples (n<50), outliers/noise.

**Why They Matter**: Real applications often high-dimensional, temporal, conditional, or have limited/noisy data.

## Practical Implications

- **Reliability**: Shows when engression works
- **Sample size guidance**: How much data needed
- **Quality thresholds**: MMD<0.1, p>0.05
- **Resource planning**: Training time estimates

## Theoretical Insights

- Quantifies difficulty across distribution types
- Shows sample size scaling behavior
- Validates simple architectures suffice
- Reveals reconstruction vs. diversity trade-offs

**Caveat**: Results specific to 1D, n=100-1000, this architecture.

## Future Work

**Short-term** (2-4 weeks): Multivariate distributions, baseline comparisons, architecture variants

**Medium-term** (3-6 months): High dimensions, theoretical analysis

**Long-term** (1+ year): Real data applications, adaptive architectures, federated learning
